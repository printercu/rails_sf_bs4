# Sample rails app to tune SimpleForm for Bootstrap4

[Online Demo](https://rails-sf-bs4.herokuapp.com/) (wait a little for heroku to start the app).

While Bootstrap4 is still beta, it's bpossible to have it working with SimpleForm with some issues.
Basic features works fine.

For now it requires custom CSS and small patch for SimpleForm to make everything work.
I hope it's better to wait for BS4 release to fix everything else.
